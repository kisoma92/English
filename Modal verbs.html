          <h3>What is modal verbs?</h3>
          <p>Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that show a person's ability or intention to do something.The modal verbs we mostly use are <i>can,will and must,as well as may</i>. Example,we use <i>can</i> to show abiliy:I <i><u>can</u> read and write but my baby brother <u> can't</u></i>.We use <i> will</i> to show that we intend to do something:He will learn to drive</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Modal Verbs do not change their endings depending on the number or person,for example I <i>can</i> you <i> can</i> he/she,/it <i>can</i> ,we <i>can</i> ,you <i>can</i> ,they <i> can</i></li>
       <li>Modal verb are used together with another verb,For example: I can+swim,he/she/it <u>can</u> swim,he/she/it <u>can</u> swim(singular)</li>
                     <li>To form the negative ,we use the negative of the modal verb and add the base verb,for example.<i>I can't dive,you can't dive,they can't dive,I will not/won't lie,..he will not /won't lie.</i></li>
                  
          </ul>    
        </div>

          <h3>Noun- verb agreement</h3>
          On page 4 you read that the verb has to agree with the subject
          <p>The subject of sentence is the person or thing that does an action.</p>
      <h3>For example</h3>
      <ul>
     <li> The girl speaks English,the subject.is the girl because she is the one who does the action of speaking English</li>
     <li>The subject of the sentence can be either be a noun(.or noun phrase like <i>the big girl and her little</i> dog)</li>
     <li>You can always check for the subject by asking questions like <u>Who</u> (or what)<i>Speaks English?</i></li></ul>
     <h3>Here are some simple    rules for noun-verb agreement</h3>
     <ul>
         <li>We check if the subject is 1st,2nd 3rd person singular or plural.you have learnt that with most present tense verbs,the 3rd person singular (he/she/it ) has  a different ending to the verb for all other person.This Rule is the same for pronoun as for nouns</li>
         <li>We decide if the subject of the sentence is singular or plural.This is normally easy,but what do we do in cases like</li>
     </ul>
     <p><i>Anita and Mei _____ to the market.</i> .We say <i> Anita  goes to the market.and Mei goes to the market.Anita and Mei are two people.=><i>Anita and mei(they) go to the market</i>.</p>
     <p><i>Anita or Mei ____ here</i>.We say Anita is her and Mei is here.The word <b> or</b> means that it <b>either</b> Anita or Mei <b> but not both of them</b>
     Therefore we say <i>Anita  or Mei is here</i></p>
     <p>Neither Anita nor Mei_______to go(want).We say Neither Anita or Mei wants to go . <b>Neither one of them wants to go</b></p>
     <ul>
         <li>Some subjects have two nouns,where one of noun is plural and the other is singular,</li>
         <h3>For example</h3>
         <p>Haji and his sisters_____to learn Portuguese.(want)</p>
         <li>We use the plural verb form <i>Haji and his sisters</i> <b>want </b>to learn Portuguese.<i>They want learn it</i></li>
         <li>Because his sisters are mentioned last ,and because<i>his sisters</i> is plural subject,we also use the plural form <i>want</i>(not wants)</li>
         <h3>For example</h3><p><i>Either Haji or his sisters wants to learn kiswahili</i></p>
         <p><i>Neither Haji nor his sisters</i></p>
         <p>Neither Haji nor his sister <b>want to learn Dutch</b></p>
         <li>When a sentence has two different pronouns,it sometimes becomes a bit tricky.. Normally we use the verb form for the pronoun last mentioned in the subject</li>
         <h3>For example</h3>
         <p>He or I <b>know</b> the answer.She or they go . Neither you nor I <b>want</b> to go</p>
         <li>When we talk aboutva whole group of things or people, like:crowd of people or a herd of cattle ,We usually use the singular verb form</li>
         <h3>For example</h3>
         <p><i>There is a crowd of people at the part</i></p>
         <p><i>The herd of zebra looks enormous</i></p>
     </ul>
     <h3>quiz</h3>
     Rewrite the sentence using the right ver  form
     <ol style="1">
         <li>Jack and Dora____visitining Mahale Mountains National Park (be)</li>
         <li>Neither you nor I _______ to go there (want)</li>
         <li>Either Kwasi of Amri____, going e Safari (like)</li>
         <li>Neither Sabra nor her parents evere_____ away,(go)</li>
         <li>At the game paek,a crowd of people always_______ at  the waterhole (collect)</li>
         <li>Herds of buffalo and other animals________into view (come)</li>
         <li>A flock of Egyptian geese_____by overhead (fly)</li>
         <li>Each of the tourists______ lotnof pictures (take)</li>
