          <h3>What the meaning of Verb</h3>
          <p><b>Verbs </b>are words that show an action of the subject.Verbs are an important part of any language.The most basic part of  any English sentence.</b</p>
          <h3>The are two main types of verb.These are</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Transitive verb</li>
              <li>Intransitive verb</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Transitive verbs </h3>
              <p>These are verb that containing direct object such as noun and pronoun</p>
              <h3>For example</h3>
             <p> The kid play football</p>
             <p>I going to buy car now</p>
             <p> That really joking me</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
      .
          <h3>Intransitive verb </h3>
          <p>These are verbs that not show object direct</p>
          <h3>For example</h3>
         <p> His dog died suddenly last night</p>
         <p>Two boys were singing loudly</p>
        Also one verb can contain both types of verb (Transitive and intransitive) uses
        <h3>For example</h3>
        <p>They are singing songs</p>
        <p>They have been playing football evening</p>
        <p>Also a transitive verb can have inderect object such as pronoun or noun phrase that comes before a direct object and indicate the person or thing that receives what  is done</p>
        <h3>For example</h3>
        <p>Can you give me a pen</p>
        <p>Who told her this information </p>
        </div>
    
          <h3 style=color:green>Note</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>The subject of every  sentence must have a verb</li>
              <li>The verb has to agree  with  the subject (for example,I <u>am </u>but He <u>is</u> )</li>
              <li>A verb either tells us about an action the  subject is performing (for example,<i>She's singing</i>) or about the condition or state(for example Our class is big) </li>
              <li>A verb and its tense tells us about the time of an event/action or condition.Often it also tell us  if the event/action <b>is short, happens often or carries on for longer time</b></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Forming verbs</h2>
          <h3>Verb endings depend on the number or person</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>In the present tense ,verbs have different endings depending on the number or person used.For example,we say:<i>I <u>sing</u> at the concert.He <u> sings</u> in the shower.We never <u>sing together.</u></i></li>
          <li>Most verbs in simple preseny tense just get an -s ending for 3rd person singular nouns like <i>man, woman,book</i> and 3rd person singular pronoun <i>he,she and it</i></li>
          <li>Depending on the verb,the 3rd person singular ending can change slightly.In verbs ending on an -o,we add-es for the 3rd person singular.For example <i>I go to school.She <u>goes </u> to the theatre.We <u> go</u> to bed at end of this day</i></li>
          <li>In verbs ending on an -s,-sh,-ch,-z or -x, we also add -es for the 3rd person singular
          For example <i>I <u>watch</u> TV.She <u>watches</u> the rugby <u>match</u>We <u> watch </u> the girls the put up tent </i></li>
          <li>In verbs ending on a consonant followed by -y,We change the -y  to an i and add ed for  the 3rd person singular.For example ,<i>I <u>worry</u> about my exams a lof.He never <u> worries</u> but they <u>worry</u> like me</i></li>
          </ul>
