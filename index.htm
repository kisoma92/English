          <h3>Countable and uncountable nouns</h3>
          <p>This section is about countable and uncoutable nouns ,and the quantifiers like <i>much,many,some,both,all,enough </i> which we use to describe them</p>
          <p>When we talk about Suger quantity we means Mass of sugar.Though the heap of sugar contain many seperate sugar crystals,When we talk about sugar we talk about an amount of sugar,and not about numbers.That is  why we say sugar is an uncountable noun.</p>
          <p>Apples,Orange,and watermelon on  other hand,are easily <b>Counted</b> and and so we talk about their <b>number</b>:<i>How many oranges are there</i> ? üçäüçäüçä .There are three oranges</p>

          <h2>What differences between countable and uncountable</h2>
          <p><b>Countable nouns </b> have a <b> plural</b> form but uncountable noun don't </p>
   <h2> Example of countable nouns</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>One <u>apple</u></li>
       <li>Two <u>apples</u></li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Example of uncountable nouns</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>Lump of <u>sugar</u></li> 
      <li>Two spoonfuls of <u>sugar</u></li>
   </ul>
   <p>We can use <u><b>a</b></u> or <u><b>an</b></u> before a <b> countable nouns</b> but not  before uncountable nouns</p>
   <h2>For example</h2>
   a bean,An apple but not sugar, sunlight
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <img src="./img/logo_brush.png">
          <h3>Countable and uncountable nouns and quantifiers</h3>
          <p>A quantifiers is a word or a number of words,that describes the quantity or number of something.When we say  <i>a lump of sugar,we described the amount</i> <i>'a lump of Suger'</i>we described the amount of sugar by saying 'a lump of'.We use words like <i>much,more,and many, enough and too little,any or some and all</i> and no to talk about amounts and numbers.These words are all quantifiers</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Quantifiers come before the noun or noun phrase they quantity</li>
              <li>Which quantifiers come before the noun or noun phrase they quantify.uncountable:for example.we say much money but many coins</li>
              <li>Some quantifier can be used with both types on nouns.They are :<i> enough,more,some,alof /lots of,any ,all and no</i></li>
              <li>Some quantifiers can only be used with countable nouns:<i>few/a few/fewer/many/each and every,both</i></li>
              <li>Other quantifiers can only be used with uncountable nouns:<i>little/a little,less.</im>It's really down to practice.The more you practice the more confident you will be at using quantifiers correctly</li>
              <li>One common mistake is to confuse less and fewer.We say :<i>There are is less sand in the Nami b Desert than in the Sahara but there are fewer people at this concert than than there were last night</i></li>
          </ul>
		 <h3>Pronouns</h3>
          <h4>what is pronouns?</h4>
          <p><b>Pronouns</b>are words that we use in place of noun</p>
          <h2>What are types of pronouns</h2>
          <p>There are three main types of pronoun these are:</p>
          <ol style="1">
              <li>personal pronouns</li>
              <li>Relative  pronoun</li>
              <li>possessive pronouns</li>
        </div>
        
          <h2>Let us start with Personal pronouns</h2>
          <h4>personal pronouns  can be  divided in two groups</h4>
          <ol style="1">
              <li>Personal Singular pronoun(he,she,it)</li><li>Personal plural pronoun(you,we ,they)</li></ol>
        </div>
        
          <h3>Let us start discussing with singular pronouns</h3>
          <p><b> Personal Singular pronouns </b> such as  he,she and it.Each pronoun has spesific role .Let start with one by one .We start with <b style=color:pink>She</b></p>
          <h4>How to use personal pronoun <b style=color:pink>She</b></h4>
    <h4 ><b style =color:pink>She</b> ==>pronoun used in place of noun for Female gender of people</h4>
    <h4>For example of female gender of people are the mother, grandmother,sisiter, daughter,girl,Mariam,Asha,Juliet and Ester and so on</h4>
     <h2>How to replace pronoun from noun .See an Example below</h2>
     <ul>

   <li> <b style=color:pink>She</b> likes to eat meat,fish snd vegetables</li>
    <b style=color:pink>She</b> is still strong woman
     </ul>
        <h2> Example 2</h2>
       <p> Asha is beautiful girl  in the classroom
Note "Asha" is proper noun.Now we change this  noun into Pronoun.What pronoun fit for Asha?<b style=color:pink>She</b>
 <li><b style=color:pink>She </b>is beautiful girl in the classroom</li>
<li><b style=color:pink>She    </b>is tall and white girl in the classroom</li>

<li><b style=color:pink>She </b>likes music and movies</li>
<li><b style =color:pink>She </b>likes ice cream and chocolate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example3</h2>
Helena is the first born in her family
"Helena"is proper noun .Change this noun into pronoun<b style =color:pink>'She'</b>
Take away helena in that sentence then add Pronoun <b style =color:pink>'She'</b>
<p><b style =color:pink>'She'</b>is the first born in her family</p>
Who is the first born in her family ?Helena
<h2>how to use pronoun <b style =color:pink>'He'</b> in the sentence</h2>
<b style =color:pink>'He'</b> used in place of noun of the male gender of people .Example of noun of male gender people such as father , brother,Juma,Ally,Frank.husband and Clark and so on

<h2>Example2</h2>
My freind name is <u>Juma</u>
<p>He is Taller than me</p>
  <p>He likes ice cream and chocolate</p> 
  <p>He is very lazy because of his body weight </p>
  <h2>How to use Personal pronoun "it" </h2>
  <p>We use "it" pronoun for Animals,Trees, insects ,water body ,ocean and all non living things nouns and sometime  we use "it" without meaning any thing For example ,when we say 'it is raining,or it is hot</p>
  <p><b style=color:pink>Note</b>Personal pronouns change depending on their position and function in the sentence</p>
  <h4>Example of Animals nouns are Dog,Cow,goat,lion and üêñ </h4>

 <p>It is powerful animal in the forest</p>
 <p>It runs faster than humman being</p>
    <p>It has sharp  teeth compared to other animal</p>

	    <h3>What the meaning of Verb</h3>
          <p><b>Verbs </b>are words that show an action of the subject.Verbs are an important part of any language.The most basic part of  any English sentence.</b</p>
          <h3>The are two main types of verb.These are</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Transitive verb</li>
              <li>Intransitive verb</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Transitive verbs </h3>
              <p>These are verb that containing direct object such as noun and pronoun</p>
              <h3>For example</h3>
             <p> The kid play football</p>
             <p>I going to buy car now</p>
             <p> That really joking me</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
      .
          <h3>Intransitive verb </h3>
          <p>These are verbs that not show object direct</p>
          <h3>For example</h3>
         <p> His dog died suddenly last night</p>
         <p>Two boys were singing loudly</p>
        Also one verb can contain both types of verb (Transitive and intransitive) uses
        <h3>For example</h3>
        <p>They are singing songs</p>
        <p>They have been playing football evening</p>
        <p>Also a transitive verb can have inderect object such as pronoun or noun phrase that comes before a direct object and indicate the person or thing that receives what  is done</p>
        <h3>For example</h3>
        <p>Can you give me a pen</p>
        <p>Who told her this information </p>
        </div>
    
          <h3 style=color:green>Note</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>The subject of every  sentence must have a verb</li>
              <li>The verb has to agree  with  the subject (for example,I <u>am </u>but He <u>is</u> )</li>
              <li>A verb either tells us about an action the  subject is performing (for example,<i>She's singing</i>) or about the condition or state(for example Our class is big) </li>
              <li>A verb and its tense tells us about the time of an event/action or condition.Often it also tell us  if the event/action <b>is short, happens often or carries on for longer time</b></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Forming verbs</h2>
          <h3>Verb endings depend on the number or person</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>In the present tense ,verbs have different endings depending on the number or person used.For example,we say:<i>I <u>sing</u> at the concert.He <u> sings</u> in the shower.We never <u>sing together.</u></i></li>
          <li>Most verbs in simple preseny tense just get an -s ending for 3rd person singular nouns like <i>man, woman,book</i> and 3rd person singular pronoun <i>he,she and it</i></li>
          <li>Depending on the verb,the 3rd person singular ending can change slightly.In verbs ending on an -o,we add-es for the 3rd person singular.For example <i>I go to school.She <u>goes </u> to the theatre.We <u> go</u> to bed at end of this day</i></li>
          <li>In verbs ending on an -s,-sh,-ch,-z or -x, we also add -es for the 3rd person singular
          For example <i>I <u>watch</u> TV.She <u>watches</u> the rugby <u>match</u>We <u> watch </u> the girls the put up tent </i></li>
          <li>In verbs ending on a consonant followed by -y,We change the -y  to an i and add ed for  the 3rd person singular.For example ,<i>I <u>worry</u> about my exams a lof.He never <u> worries</u> but they <u>worry</u> like me</i></li>
          </ul>

	    <h3>What is modal verbs?</h3>
          <p>Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that show a person's ability or intention to do something.The modal verbs we mostly use are <i>can,will and must,as well as may</i>. Example,we use <i>can</i> to show abiliy:I <i><u>can</u> read and write but my baby brother <u> can't</u></i>.We use <i> will</i> to show that we intend to do something:He will learn to drive</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Modal Verbs do not change their endings depending on the number or person,for example I <i>can</i> you <i> can</i> he/she,/it <i>can</i> ,we <i>can</i> ,you <i>can</i> ,they <i> can</i></li>
       <li>Modal verb are used together with another verb,For example: I can+swim,he/she/it <u>can</u> swim,he/she/it <u>can</u> swim(singular)</li>
                     <li>To form the negative ,we use the negative of the modal verb and add the base verb,for example.<i>I can't dive,you can't dive,they can't dive,I will not/won't lie,..he will not /won't lie.</i></li>
                  
          </ul>

          <h3>Noun- verb agreement</h3>
          On page 4 you read that the verb has to agree with the subject
          <p>The subject of sentence is the person or thing that does an action.</p>
      <h3>For example</h3>
      <ul>
     <li> The girl speaks English,the subject.is the girl because she is the one who does the action of speaking English</li>
     <li>The subject of the sentence can be either be a noun(.or noun phrase like <i>the big girl and her little</i> dog)</li>
     <li>You can always check for the subject by asking questions like <u>Who</u> (or what)<i>Speaks English?</i></li></ul>
     <h3>Here are some simple    rules for noun-verb agreement</h3>
     <ul>
         <li>We check if the subject is 1st,2nd 3rd person singular or plural.you have learnt that with most present tense verbs,the 3rd person singular (he/she/it ) has  a different ending to the verb for all other person.This Rule is the same for pronoun as for nouns</li>
         <li>We decide if the subject of the sentence is singular or plural.This is normally easy,but what do we do in cases like</li>
     </ul>
     <p><i>Anita and Mei _____ to the market.</i> .We say <i> Anita  goes to the market.and Mei goes to the market.Anita and Mei are two people.=><i>Anita and mei(they) go to the market</i>.</p>
     <p><i>Anita or Mei ____ here</i>.We say Anita is her and Mei is here.The word <b> or</b> means that it <b>either</b> Anita or Mei <b> but not both of them</b>
     Therefore we say <i>Anita  or Mei is here</i></p>
     <p>Neither Anita nor Mei_______to go(want).We say Neither Anita or Mei wants to go . <b>Neither one of them wants to go</b></p>
     <ul>
         <li>Some subjects have two nouns,where one of noun is plural and the other is singular,</li>
         <h3>For example</h3>
         <p>Haji and his sisters_____to learn Portuguese.(want)</p>
         <li>We use the plural verb form <i>Haji and his sisters</i> <b>want </b>to learn Portuguese.<i>They want learn it</i></li>
         <li>Because his sisters are mentioned last ,and because<i>his sisters</i> is plural subject,we also use the plural form <i>want</i>(not wants)</li>
         <h3>For example</h3><p><i>Either Haji or his sisters wants to learn kiswahili</i></p>
         <p><i>Neither Haji nor his sisters</i></p>
         <p>Neither Haji nor his sister <b>want to learn Dutch</b></p>
         <li>When a sentence has two different pronouns,it sometimes becomes a bit tricky.. Normally we use the verb form for the pronoun last mentioned in the subject</li>
         <h3>For example</h3>
         <p>He or I <b>know</b> the answer.She or they go . Neither you nor I <b>want</b> to go</p>
         <li>When we talk aboutva whole group of things or people, like:crowd of people or a herd of cattle ,We usually use the singular verb form</li>
         <h3>For example</h3>
         <p><i>There is a crowd of people at the part</i></p>
         <p><i>The herd of zebra looks enormous</i></p>
     </ul>
