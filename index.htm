          <h3>Countable and uncountable nouns</h3>
          <p>This section is about countable and uncoutable nouns ,and the quantifiers like <i>much,many,some,both,all,enough </i> which we use to describe them</p>
          <p>When we talk about Suger quantity we means Mass of sugar.Though the heap of sugar contain many seperate sugar crystals,When we talk about sugar we talk about an amount of sugar,and not about numbers.That is  why we say sugar is an uncountable noun.</p>
          <p>Apples,Orange,and watermelon on  other hand,are easily <b>Counted</b> and and so we talk about their <b>number</b>:<i>How many oranges are there</i> ? üçäüçäüçä .There are three oranges</p>

          <h2>What differences between countable and uncountable</h2>
          <p><b>Countable nouns </b> have a <b> plural</b> form but uncountable noun don't </p>
   <h2> Example of countable nouns</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>One <u>apple</u></li>
       <li>Two <u>apples</u></li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Example of uncountable nouns</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>Lump of <u>sugar</u></li> 
      <li>Two spoonfuls of <u>sugar</u></li>
   </ul>
   <p>We can use <u><b>a</b></u> or <u><b>an</b></u> before a <b> countable nouns</b> but not  before uncountable nouns</p>
   <h2>For example</h2>
   a bean,An apple but not sugar, sunlight

          <h3>Countable and uncountable nouns and quantifiers</h3>
          <p>A quantifiers is a word or a number of words,that describes the quantity or number of something.When we say  <i>a lump of sugar,we described the amount</i> <i>'a lump of Suger'</i>we described the amount of sugar by saying 'a lump of'.We use words like <i>much,more,and many, enough and too little,any or some and all</i> and no to talk about amounts and numbers.These words are all quantifiers</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Quantifiers come before the noun or noun phrase they quantity</li>
              <li>Which quantifiers come before the noun or noun phrase they quantify.uncountable:for example.we say much money but many coins</li>
              <li>Some quantifier can be used with both types on nouns.They are :<i> enough,more,some,alof /lots of,any ,all and no</i></li>
              <li>Some quantifiers can only be used with countable nouns:<i>few/a few/fewer/many/each and every,both</i></li>
              <li>Other quantifiers can only be used with uncountable nouns:<i>little/a little,less.</im>It's really down to practice.The more you practice the more confident you will be at using quantifiers correctly</li>
              <li>One common mistake is to confuse less and fewer.We say :<i>There are is less sand in the Nami b Desert than in the Sahara but there are fewer people at this concert than than there were last night</i></li>
          </ul>
		 <h3>Pronouns</h3>
